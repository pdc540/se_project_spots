# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

Project name: Spots

Description: This project displays the users photos on a desktop while also being adaptable for viewing on smaller screens and mobile devices. The design of the website changes according to the user's screen size.
This was achieved by using a grid display for the images and media queries that change the design when the screen reaches a certain width.
The profile which includes the person's avatar, description, edit button and new post button adapt to the width with a flex container that switches from a row direction to a centered column direction when the screen is smaller.
The buttons in the project change depending on if the user's mouse is hovering over them as well.
